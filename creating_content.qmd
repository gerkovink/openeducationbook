# Creating Content {#sec-creating_content}

In this Chapter we aim to provide some guidance on how to create content with openness in mind. Clearly we cannot create content for you, but we hope that the suggestions in this Chapter will be useful considerations for when you design your materials. What we also won't do here is help you to structure your curiculum. There are plenty of other resources for that, see for instance XXX and XXX. What we focus on here is what we think is impoartant in relation to thinking open whilst creating new content. That means that we do not focus on opening up existing materials or updating what has been created in this Chapter. In @sec-updating_content we will discuss how to keep content up to date and how to update content whilst making it open.

## Open Principles

In @sec-open_education we descibed the core principles and pedagogical foundations of open education.

> Open education is anchored in the belief that education is a universal right. It denotes a dynamic, learner-centric approach to education that seeks to remove barriers to learning and promote equal access to knowledge. Open educational practices are rooted in inclusivity, collaboration, and a focus on improving quality and learner outcomes.

> At the heart of open education lies an enhanced pedagogical ethos that is inherently flexible and diverse, accommodating a variety of learning styles and needs. 

Creating Content with Open Principles in Mind

- Share your work: Gaining recognition and impact in the educational community.
- Enriching your content and staying up-to-date through continuous community contributions.

## Testing

Make sure you test your content. 

-  Can it be opened using all devices? 
-  Can it be opened using different operating systems? 
-  Can it be opened using different software? 
-  Can it be opened using different browsers? 
-  Can it be opened using different screen sizes? 
-  Can it be opened only with internet connections? 
-  Can it be opened using different color blindness settings? 

## Prepare for the Future

- make sure issues can be reported/ tracked.
