# openeducationbook

This repository holds all contents of the Open Education book written by Gerko Vink and Duco Veen.

You can contribute to the book by creating a [pull request](https://github.com/gerkovink/openeducationbook/pulls).

To render the book locally, make sure your machine is set up for [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), clone the repository, and run `quarto render`. An alternative to the last step in RStudio is to open `index.qmd`^[or any other Quarto source file from the repository] and click the 'Render' button in the tool bar.
