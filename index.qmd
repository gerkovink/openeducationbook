With pride, we present to you this book on Open Educational Materials (OEM). This book has been written with the assistance of ChatGPT, a program that has helped us explain all the information related to this topic in a clear manner.

Our goal with this book is to provide a free, comprehensive, and easily understandable source of information for people interested in OEM. We firmly believe that everyone should have access to high-quality educational resources, regardless of their financial resources.

We hope that this book will serve as a valuable source of information for you. We express our gratitude to ChatGPT, which has assisted us in writing this book.
