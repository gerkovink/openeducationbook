@book{NAP11153,
	abstract = {Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research examines current interdisciplinary research efforts and recommends ways to stimulate and support such research.  \n\nAdvances in science and engineering increasingly require the collaboration of scholars from various fields.  This shift is driven by the need to address complex problems that cut across traditional disciplines, and the capacity of new technologies to both transform existing disciplines and generate new ones.  At the same time, however, interdisciplinary research can be impeded by policies on hiring, promotion, tenure, proposal review, and resource allocation that favor traditional disciplines.\n\nThis report identifies steps that researchers, teachers, students, institutions, funding organizations, and disciplinary societies can take to more effectively conduct, facilitate, and evaluate interdisciplinary research programs and projects.  Throughout the report key concepts are illustrated with case studies and results of the committee\u2019s surveys of individual researchers and university provosts. \n},
