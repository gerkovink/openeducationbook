    "text": "3.1 Making it open: Prospective or Retrospective\nEmbracing open education represents a profound shift in the way we create, share, and interact with educational resources. As you embark on this journey, one of the first decisions you’ll encounter is whether to make existing educational materials open (retrospective), start new projects with open education in mind (prospective), or a combination of both.\nEach approach comes with its own set of challenges and rewards. On one hand, opening up existing materials can provide immediate benefits in terms of accessibility and collaboration. On the other hand, this approach can be time-consuming and complex, especially when dealing with issues such as copyright and the technical aspects of transforming existing resources into open formats.\nStarting fresh with open education in mind when developing new materials, however, can often be a more streamlined process. From the outset, you can design your resources to be open, eliminating the need for later adaptations. Yet, this approach may mean that valuable existing resources remain closed off, at least in the short term.\nThe decision between these two approaches is not a binary one. A successful open education initiative often incorporates elements of both strategies. Opening up materials is always a win, but it’s crucial to strike a balance between feasibility, effort, and the eventual result. You might find that while some existing resources lend themselves well to being opened retrospectively, for others, it might be more worthwhile to leave them as they are and focus on incorporating open principles in new projects.\nRemember, the ultimate goal is to improve the accessibility and adaptability of educational resources. Whether you achieve this by opening existing materials or designing new ones with openness in mind will depend on your unique circumstances, resources, and goals. Let’s explore these two approaches in greater detail.\n\n3.1.1 Starting Open Prospectively\n\nPlanning for Openness from the Start\n\n\nThe importance of setting clear goals and understanding your audience.\n\nWhen embarking on a journey to create open educational materials, having a clear sense of direction is crucial. This starts with setting clear goals for your open education project. What do you hope to achieve by making your educational materials open? Is it to increase (free) access to quality education, promote collaboration among learners, or adapt to diverse learning needs and styles? Having a clear understanding of your goals will guide your decisions throughout the project and help you measure your success.\nAt the same time, you should also seek to understand your audience, as this will heavily influence the design and presentation of your open educational materials. Who are your learners? What are their learning needs and preferences? How tech-savvy are they? What languages do they speak? Do they have specific accessibility needs? An understanding of your audience will ensure that your open educational materials are relevant, useful, and accessible to those who need them.\nSetting clear goals and understanding your audience might require some research and reflection, but it’s worth the effort. These two aspects form the foundation upon which successful open education projects are built. They ensure that your project stays focused, meets learners’ needs, and achieves its intended impact. So before you delve into the details of creating open educational materials, take some time to outline your goals and understand your audience, Table 3.1 can help you. It’s your first step towards a successful open education project.\n\n\nTable 3.1: Scoping questions for goals and target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYour Answers\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve by making your educational materials open?\n\n\n\nWho are your learners?\n\n\n\nWhat are their learning needs and preferences?\n\n\n\nHow tech-savvy are your learners?\n\n\n\nWhat languages do your learners speak?\n\n\n\nDo your learners have specific accessibility needs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the right open format and platform that suits your needs.\nWhat is the scope of how open you want to make it? Does it include (practice) exams?\nConsidering the legal aspects from the onset – Intellectual Property, Copyright, Public Domain, and Creative Commons licenses.
