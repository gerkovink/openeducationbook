    "text": "3.1 Making it open: Prospective or Retrospective\nEmbracing open education represents a profound shift in the way we create, share, and interact with educational resources. As you embark on this journey, one of the first decisions you’ll encounter is whether to make existing educational materials open (retrospective), start new projects with open education in mind (prospective), or a combination of both.\nEach approach comes with its own set of challenges and rewards. On one hand, opening up existing materials can provide immediate benefits in terms of accessibility and collaboration. On the other hand, this approach can be time-consuming and complex, especially when dealing with issues such as copyright and the technical aspects of transforming existing resources into open formats.\nStarting fresh with open education in mind when developing new materials, however, can often be a more streamlined process. From the outset, you can design your resources to be open, eliminating the need for later adaptations. Yet, this approach may mean that valuable existing resources remain closed off, at least in the short term.\nThe decision between these two approaches is not a binary one. A successful open education initiative often incorporates elements of both strategies. Opening up materials is always a win, but it’s crucial to strike a balance between feasibility, effort, and the eventual result. You might find that while some existing resources lend themselves well to being opened retrospectively, for others, it might be more worthwhile to leave them as they are and focus on incorporating open principles in new projects.\nRemember, the ultimate goal is to improve the accessibility and adaptability of educational resources. Whether you achieve this by opening existing materials or designing new ones with openness in mind will depend on your unique circumstances, resources, and goals. Let’s explore these two approaches in greater detail.\n\n3.1.1 Starting Open Prospectively\nEmbarking on the journey of creating open educational materials is a rewarding endeavor, but like all significant initiatives, it requires structured planning and execution. This process is delineated into four pivotal stages:\n\nPlanning for Openness: This initial stage lays the foundation. It involves understanding the why, what, and for whom you are creating the materials. It’s about aligning your objectives with the needs of your audience and considering the practicalities involved. Information on this stage will be presented in this chapter.\nCreating Content: Once the groundwork is established, the focus shifts to the content. This stage is dedicated to crafting high-quality, accessible, and engaging materials. It encompasses not just the creation, but also the considerations of format, adaptability, and inclusivity. In Chapter 4 more details on this stage can be found.\nLaunch and Implementation: Here, the prepared materials are introduced to the world. This phase involves selecting the right platform, ensuring easy access for your target audience, and setting up mechanisms for feedback and interaction. For this, you need to work with the right resources, details on which can be found in Chapter 6.\nLeveraging Benefits: The final stage revolves around the post-launch period. It’s about amplifying the advantages of open materials, such as promoting educational equity, sharing your work with a broader audience, and fostering community collaboration. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement based on feedback and evolving educational trends. See Chapter 7 for more information.\n\nFor each of these stages, we will delve into specific phases, breaking them down to offer a comprehensive understanding. For every phase, actionable steps will be outlined to guide you seamlessly through the process of starting open prospectively.\nPrepare to embark on a fulfilling journey that not only enhances educational access but also fosters a culture of collaboration and continuous learning.\n\n\n\n3.1.1.1 Planning for Openness\n\n3.1.1.1.1 Scoping\nWhen embarking on a journey to create open educational materials, having a clear sense of direction is crucial. This starts with setting clear goals for your open education project. What do you hope to achieve by making your educational materials open? Is it to increase (free) access to quality education, promote collaboration among learners, or adapt to diverse learning needs and styles? Having a clear understanding of your goals will guide your decisions throughout the project and help you measure your success.\nAt the same time, you should also seek to understand your audience, as this will heavily influence the design and presentation of your open educational materials. Who are your learners? What are their learning needs and preferences? How tech-savvy are they? What languages do they speak? Do they have specific accessibility needs? An understanding of your audience will ensure that your open educational materials are relevant, useful, and accessible to those who need them.\nSetting clear goals and understanding your audience might require some research and reflection, but it’s worth the effort. These two aspects form the foundation upon which successful open education projects are built. In this section we help you to clarify your goals by means of asking you scoping questions. They ensure that your project stays focused, meets learners’ needs, and achieves its intended impact. So before you delve into the details of creating open educational materials, take some time to outline your goals and understand your audience, Table 3.1 can help you. It’s your first step towards a successful open education project.\n\n\nTable 3.1: Scoping questions for goals and target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYour Answers\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve by making your educational materials open?\n\n\n\nWho are your learners?\n\n\n\nWhat are their learning needs and preferences?\n\n\n\nHow tech-savvy are your learners?\n\n\n\nWhat languages do your learners speak?\n\n\n\nDo your learners have specific accessibility needs?\n\n\n\nAre there assignments?\n\n\n\nDo learners need to hand-in work? Or can it done online?\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you thought about your goals and target audience, the next step is choosing the right format and platform that suits your needs. In the realm of open education, choosing the appropriate format and platform for your materials is a decision of paramount importance. This choice influences how accessible, adaptable, and collaborative your resources will be.\nFormat pertains to the type of file or medium you’ll use to present your content. For instance, while a PDF might be universally readable, it’s not as editable as a Markdown or an Office document. Likewise, video materials may be engaging, but they might pose accessibility challenges without accompanying transcripts. Table 3.2 is meant to help you think though your choices. You can fill it out for each of your educational materials and start considering if you are using the right formats.\n\n\nTable 3.2: Considerations for Choosing Format and Platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYour Answers\n\n\n\n\nWhich educational format will you be using? (e.g., videos, text, interactive exercises)\n\n\n\nHow frequently do you anticipate updates to the material?\n\n\n\nWill there be collaboration with others in content creation or revision?\n\n\n\nIs feedback from users/learners desirable?\n\n\n\nAre there any other specific technical requirements or considerations for your materials?\n\n\n\nDo the materials need to be editable?\n\n\n\nWhat file formats will you be sharing information in? (e.g., PDF, Powerpoint, Markdown, Jupyter Notebook) Are these formats able to handle the your goals above?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform, on the other hand, is about where and how you host and share your content. The platform dictates how learners access your materials, how they interact with them, and how they collaborate or contribute. While we’ll dive deeper into concrete options for platforms in Chapter 6, it’s essential to reflect on a few questions when starting to think about designing open materials. A well-chosen format and platform can enhance the openness, reach, and impact of your educational materials, ensuring they resonate with and benefit your intended audience. But how far can, and do you want, to go. For now, we will leave you with a few questions to consider in Table 3.3\n\n\nTable 3.3: Platform Choice Considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYour Answers\n\n\n\n\nAre you allowed to use any platform you choose for your course?\n\n\n\nHow interactive do you want the learning experience to be?\n\n\n\nDo you want interactions with students to be open and visible to the whole world?\n\n\n\nDo you want assignments and student submissions to be public?\n\n\n\nWhat tech tools are your target audience familiar with?\n\n\n\nIs community collaboration in content creation a goal?\n\n\n\nDo you want insight into the collaboration between students?\n\n\n\nWhat kind of analytics or feedback mechanisms are you seeking?\n\n\n\nWould you like to see contributions in group assignments?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource and Time Commitment: For any open education initiative, understanding the resources at your disposal is critical. This includes time, budget, technical expertise, and other support mechanisms.\nStakeholder Buy-in: Is everyone on board with the open education initiative? If there are multiple stakeholders (faculty, administration, etc.), have their concerns and inputs been considered?\nEvaluation Metrics: How will you measure the success of your open education initiative? While some metrics (like the number of users) are quantitative, others might be qualitative, like feedback or testimonials.\nChallenges & Barriers: Anticipate potential challenges. For example, will there be resistance from some educators or learners? What about technical challenges?\n\nDoes it all feel like a bit much to keep track of? Don’t worry, in Figure 3.1 you can find back the steps that have been described. Additionally, the figure will be updated after each relevant section such that, step by step, the sequence of actions to create open educational materials will be mapped.\n\n\n\n\n\ntimeline\n  title Starting Open Prospectively\n  section Planning for Openness\n    Scoping : Goals Setting\n           : Understanding Audience\n           : Format Selection\n           : Platform Consideration\n           : Resource Assessment\n           : Stakeholder Buy-in\n           : Evaluation Metrics\n           : Anticipate Challenges\n    ... : ...\n  section Creating content\n    ... : ...\n    ... : ...\n  section Launch and Implementation\n    ... : ...\n    ... : ...\n  section Leveraging Benefits\n    ... : ...\n    ... : ...\n\n                      \n\n\nFigure 3.1: Mapping the actions that need to be taken to create open educational materials prospectively.
