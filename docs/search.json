    "text": "2.1 Core Principles\nOpen education is anchored in the belief that education is a universal right. It denotes a dynamic, learner-centric approach to education that seeks to remove barriers to learning and promote equal access to knowledge. Open educational practices are rooted in inclusivity, collaboration, and a focus on improving quality and learner outcomes.\nOpen Educational Resources (OER) play a pivotal role in the open educational paradigm. OER are defined as teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an an open license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others source: Creative Commons. They can include full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge."

    "section": "2.2 The Pedagogical Foundation",
    "text": "2.2 The Pedagogical Foundation\nAt the heart of open education lies an enhanced pedagogical ethos that is inherently flexible and diverse, accommodating a variety of learning styles and needs. This ethos aligns with the constructivist learning theory, where learning is an active, constructive process, and learners are encouraged to construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world, through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences (Brunner 1966). Constructivist learning theory aligns closely with the principles of open education in at least the following waysvarious ways:\n\nAccessibility and Flexibility: Both constructivist learning and open education emphasize the importance of making learning accessible and flexible, catering to diverse learning styles and needs.\nCollaboration and Sharing: Open education promotes the sharing and collaboration of knowledge and resources, echoing the social, interactive aspect of constructivist learning.\nLearner Autonomy: Just as constructivist learning puts the learner at the center of the education process, open education empowers learners by giving them access to a plethora of resources to explore, adapt, and create knowledge.\nReal-world Application: Open education often involves real-world, practical examples and applications, mirroring the constructivist principle of learning being rooted in real-world contexts.\nInnovation in Teaching: Both paradigms encourage innovation in teaching and learning practices, moving away from traditional, didactic methods to more interactive, engaging, and personalized approaches.\n\nWhile constructivist learning continues to be influential - platforms like Khan Academy, Coursera, and edX are embedded with constructivist principles, promoting interactive, self-paced learning - it’s not without its critiques. Challenges include the effective assessment of learning, the need for well-prepared expert educators, and ensuring that foundational knowledge is adequately imparted. Balancing constructivist approaches with direct instructional methods - i.e. a more teacher-centered approach where the teacher directs the learning process, giving clear, explicit, and straightforward instructions to students where necessary - is an ongoing conversation in the educational community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: MIT OpenCourseWare\n\n\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare (MIT OCW) stands as a beacon in the landscape of open education. Initiated in 2001, this ambitious project made virtually all MIT course content available online, free of charge, to any user anywhere in the world. The initiative encapsulates the essence of open education by offering a wealth of learning materials, including lecture notes, exams, and videos to educators, students, and self-learners to use and repurpose for non-commercial purposes under a Creative Commons license.\nMIT OCW exemplifies the transformative power of open education. Nowadays, it includes thousands of courses and has received billions of pageviews from learners and educators in virtually every country, proving the scalability and global reach of open educational practices."

    "text": "2.3 Open Education within the Context of Open Science\nOpen education and open science are complementary concepts, each amplifying the other’s reach and impact. Open education extends beyond making educational materials freely available; it’s also about promoting a culture of openness, collaboration, and sharing in the broader academic and research landscapes. This culture is essential for fostering open science, an inclusive and interdisciplinary approach to science that emphasizes transparent, reproducible, and accessible research.\nOpen education aids in the accessibility and adaptability of educational resources and data. It encapsulates an ecosystem where learners, educators, and researchers can freely use, adapt, and share resources, thereby promoting creativity, innovation, and knowledge dissemination (see e.g. Wiley and Hilton III 2018). In the context of open science, this translates into an enhanced availability of scientific data, research findings, and methodologies that are accessible and can be built upon by the global research community.\nInterdisciplinary Learning and Research  Interdisciplinarity is a cornerstone of both open education and open science. Open education facilitates the creation of diverse, interdisciplinary learning materials, thereby enabling learners and researchers to explore and integrate knowledge across various fields. Open science, likewise, promotes collaborative and interdisciplinary research practices, seeking to address complex, real-world challenges that often span multiple disciplines (National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering and Institute of Medicine 2005).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Example: Plan S\n\n\n\nPlan S serves as a fitting illustration of these open science principles in action. Initiated by cOAlition S, a consortium of national research funding organizations, Plan S mandates that all publicly funded research be published in open-access journals or platforms, ensuring the results are freely accessible to all (Schiltz 2018). This initiative amplifies the principles of both open education and open science by facilitating free access to research findings, encouraging interdisciplinary research, and promoting international collaboration.\n\n\nThe convergence of open education and open science underscores a transformative shift towards a more open, collaborative, and accessible global knowledge ecosystem. It’s a movement that transcends geographical, disciplinary, and institutional boundaries, aiming to democratize knowledge, spur innovation, and address complex challenges in a collective, inclusive manner. The above example in the box of Plan S exemplifies the practical implementation of these principles, paving the path towards a future where knowledge is not just a commodity but a shared, collective resource that empowers societies worldwide."

    "text": "2.4 A Holistic Approach to Open Education\nOpen education, in its most transformative sense, extends far beyond the provision of open access to textbooks and course materials. It represents a fundamental shift in how education is designed, delivered, and experienced. A holistic approach to open education sees it not merely as a means of content dissemination but as a dynamic ecosystem that fosters the collaborative creation, adaptation, and sharing of knowledge (Cronin 2017).\nThis educational paradigm champions the integration of open principles into every aspect of the educational journey. From the creation of content and curriculum to the enactment of pedagogical strategies and the assessment of learning, open education is characterized by transparency, adaptability, collaboration, and inclusivity.\nOpen pedagogy, for instance, empowers educators and learners to become co-creators of knowledge. It encourages innovative teaching and learning practices that transcend traditional classroom walls, leveraging open technologies and platforms to facilitate interaction, engagement, and shared learning experiences (Hegarty 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: Wikipedia Education Program\n\n\n\nThe Wikipedia Education Program exemplifies this holistic approach to open education. In this innovative program, students aren’t just consumers of information but active contributors to one of the world’s largest open knowledge repositories. It provides a learning experience that promotes both learning and collaboration.\nEnhanced Learning Through Contribution  Students, under the guidance of their instructors, create and improve Wikipedia articles related to their course content. This process not only reinforces their understanding of the subject matter but also enhances critical skills such as writing, researching, and collaborative learning. The public nature of Wikipedia means that students’ contributions are viewed and scrutinized by a global audience, adding an authentic, real-world context to the learning experience (Cummings 2009).\nGlobal Knowledge Sharing  Moreover, the Wikipedia Education Program underscores the reciprocal nature of open education. As students benefit from access to open knowledge, they also contribute to expanding this knowledge base, embodying the ethos of communal learning and global knowledge sharing.\n\n\nIn essence, a holistic approach to open education recognizes it as a multifaceted, dynamic process that transforms both teaching and learning. It fosters a learning culture rooted in collaboration, innovation, and the shared creation and dissemination of knowledge. The Wikipedia Education Program serves as a tangible manifestation of these principles, where learning is not just an individual pursuit but a collective, contributive, and globally impactful task."

    "section": "2.5 Benefits of Open Education",
    "text": "2.5 Benefits of Open Education\nThis section will delve into some of the most pivotal advantages: cost reduction, enhanced accessibility, and the fostering of innovation.\n\n2.5.1 Cost Reduction\nOne of the primary barriers to education worldwide is cost. Students often grapple with high fees for tuition, textbooks, and other learning materials, a burden that can limit access and exacerbate educational inequality. Open Educational Resources offer a viable solution. By making high-quality learning materials freely available and open for adaptation, OERs significantly reduce costs for students and educational institutions (Hilton 2016).\nA compelling testament to this is a study by the United States Government Accountability Office revealing that students sometimes have to pay more for the course materials than the tuition for the course itself (United States Government Accountability Office 2013). Opting for OER can save billions for students worldwide. This significant saving underscores the financial impact open education can have, making learning more affordable and accessible to a broader demographic.\n\n\n2.5.2 Accessibility\nBeyond cost, open education amplifies accessibility in other important ways. It ensures that learning isn’t confined to specific locations, times, or societal groups but is available to anyone with access - be it over the internet or otherwise. This democratization of education benefits both inclusivity and diversity, offering individual learning experiences that cater to varied learning styles, needs, and paces (Seaman and Seaman 2018).\n\n\n2.5.3 Innovation\nThe open nature of OERs also spawns innovation in teaching and learning. With the freedom to adapt and modify content, educators can devise novel, contextual, and engaging learning experiences that are aligned with the dynamic needs of the contemporary learner (Wiley and Hilton III 2018). Moreover, students would no longer be passive recipients of knowledge. They’re empowered to explore, interact with, and even contribute to the body of knowledge, catalyzing a more active and participatory learning process."

    "section": "2.6 The Perception of Openness as a Threat",
    "text": "2.6 The Perception of Openness as a Threat\nWhile the myriad benefits of open education are acknowledged globally, there persists a counter-narrative that perceives the openness of educational resources and methodologies as a threat. This perception is rooted in various concerns encompassing the quality of learning, intellectual property rights, and the financial sustainability of educational institutions. Critics argue that the unfettered access and adaptability of OERs could compromise the quality of educational content. The lack of a centralized authority or stringent regulatory framework for content creation and modification raises concerns about the accuracy, reliability, and pedagogical efficacy of OERs (Robinson et al. 2014).\n\n2.6.1 Intellectual Property Rights\nThe open nature of educational content also brings to the fore issues related to intellectual property rights. The freedom to adapt and share content raises questions about authorship, attribution, and the potential misuse of educational materials (Wiley, Bliss, and McEwen 2014):\n\nAuthorship:\n\nRecognition: In open education, content can be shared, adapted, and reused. It raises questions about giving appropriate credit to original authors. While Creative Commons licenses often require attribution, the multiple layers of adaptation and reuse can make authorship acknowledgment complex.\nAcademic Integrity: In academia, authorship is closely tied to professional recognition and advancement. Questions arise on how contributions to OERs are recognized in academic evaluations and career progressions.\n\nQuality Control:\n\nContent Integrity: With open access to modify and distribute content, maintaining the integrity and quality of educational materials can be challenging. There are concerns about the dilution or misinterpretation of content when it’s adapted without appropriate oversight.\nStandardization: Unlike traditional educational materials, which often undergo rigorous peer review and editorial processes, OERs can sometimes lack standardized quality control mechanisms.\n\nEconomic Implications:\n\nRevenue Generation: Content creators, especially publishers, rely on copyright protections to generate revenue. Open access challenges traditional business models, leading to concerns about compensating creators for their work.\nSustainability: The open sharing and adaptation of content can also raise questions about the economic sustainability of content creation. It requires new models for funding and supporting the development of high-quality educational materials.\n\nLegal and Ethical Concerns:\n\nCompliance: Navigating the various licenses and regulations associated with OERs can be complex. Ensuring compliance with both the letter and spirit of these licenses is crucial to maintain the ethical use of content.\nMisuse: The open nature of content also raises the risk of misuse or misappropriation. Safeguarding against such risks while maintaining openness is a nuanced challenge.\n\n\nTo navigate these complexities, initiatives like the Creative Commons have developed a suite of licenses that facilitate the legal sharing, modification, and use of creative works while ensuring attribution to original authors.\n\n\n2.6.2 Financial Sustainability\nIn traditional educational publishing, the creation, distribution, and access to educational materials are often monetized. Publishers invest in the production of high-quality content, and in return, they charge users or institutions for access. This business model ensures a revenue stream that funds the development, quality assurance, and distribution of educational materials.\nOpen education, characterized by free access and the liberty to modify and distribute content, disrupts this economic model. It eliminates or significantly reduces the direct income generated from selling textbooks or access to learning materials. This paradigm shift raises crucial questions about the financial viability of content creation and the sustainability of educational institutions and publishers (Lambert 2018).\nImpact on Stakeholders \n\nEducational Institutions: For educational institutions, the adoption of open educational resources (OERs) can lead to a reduction in income from the sale of textbooks and other proprietary educational materials. Moreover, institutions may face increased costs associated with the curation, adaptation, and maintenance of OERs to ensure their quality and relevance.\nPublishers: Publishers face a direct threat to their revenue as open access challenges the traditional sales and subscription models. With educational materials freely accessible, the value proposition of publishers comes under scrutiny.\n\nNavigating the Challenge  One strategy to mitigate these challenges involves diversifying revenue streams. Educational institutions and publishers can explore alternative means of income, such as offering premium, value-added services, or leveraging open materials to enhance the quality and appeal of their educational offerings.\nAdditionally, funding for the creation and maintenance of OERs can be sourced from public grants, private donations, or partnerships between educational institutions, government bodies, and non-profit organizations. Collaborative funding models can distribute the financial burden and ensure the continued provision of high-quality, accessible educational resources.\nPolicy and regulatory frameworks also play a pivotal role. By establishing policies that support the creation, adaptation, and dissemination of OERs, while ensuring quality and ethical standards, governments can foster an environment where open education thrives without compromising financial sustainability.\nIn practice, some universities and colleges are integrating OERs into their curriculum while maintaining optional paid textbooks or resources for those who prefer them. Publishers, on the other hand, are exploring hybrid models, offering free digital versions while selling physical copies or enhanced digital experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLobbying Against Open Education\n\n\n\nPublishers and content providers, in particular, have been known to lobby against open education policies. Organizations like the Association of American Publishers have expressed concerns that open education, particularly OERs, could lead to a significant loss in market share and revenue, impacting their ability to invest in quality content creation (Feldstein DPS et al. 2012).\nThis underscores the delicate balance that needs to be struck between promoting open access to education and ensuring that the quality of content, intellectual property rights, and financial sustainability are not undermined. It also highlights the need for good quality OERs that are aligned with the needs of contemporary learners and educators.\n\n\nThe perception of openness as a threat underscores the complexities that come with the transition towards a more open educational landscape. While the benefits of open education are evident, these concerns highlight the need for a comprehensive, multi-stakeholder approach to address the challenges and optimize the opportunities in open education. Balancing openness with quality assurance, intellectual property rights, and financial viability is paramount to harnessing the full potential of open education for global learning and development."

    "text": "3.1 Intellectual Property, Copyright, and Public Domain\nIntellectual Property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in commerce. Copyright is a law that gives the owner of original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution, usually for a limited time, with the intention of enabling the creator to receive compensation for their investment in creativity. Public Domain refers to works whose exclusive intellectual property rights have expired, been forfeited, or are inapplicable.\nIn the educational context, IP rights play a critical role in determining how educational content can be used, shared, and distributed. Copyrighted materials, for example, are typically restricted in distribution and use, requiring permissions or licenses to share or adapt. Public domain materials, on the other hand, are freely available for use by anyone for any purpose.\nEducators and institutions need to navigate these legal frameworks to utilize educational content effectively while adhering to legal and ethical standards. Understanding these terms and their implications is essential to avoid copyright infringement and promote the ethical use of resources. It is paramount\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsiderations for retroactively opening existing education\n\n\n\nMaking existing educational content openly accessible retroactively can involve complex legal and ethical considerations. Below are key aspects that should be addressed:\n\nCopyright Ownership:\n\nEvaluation: Assess who owns the copyright to the educational materials. They could be owned by the educator, the institution, or third-party contributors.\nPermissions: If the copyright is not owned by the institution or individual aiming to make the materials open, permissions must be obtained from the copyright holder to change the licensing or distribution terms.\n\nThird-party Content:\n\nIdentification: Identify any third-party content embedded within the educational materials. This could include images, text, videos, or other media.\nLicensing: Determine the licensing terms of the third-party content. Some may have restrictions on reuse or distribution that could complicate making the primary educational materials open.\n\nLicense Selection:\n\nCompatibility: Choose a license that is compatible with the intentions for use and distribution of the materials. Creative Commons licenses (see Section 3.3.1) are often used for this purpose.\nClarity: Be clear on the permissions, restrictions, and requirements of the selected license. Make sure this information is clearly communicated to potential users of the materials.\n\nEthical Considerations:\n\nPrivacy: If the materials include contributions from students or other participants, consider privacy and consent issues. It may be necessary to anonymize or remove certain content.\nQuality: Ensure that opening up the materials doesn’t compromise the quality or integrity of the educational content.\n\nTechnical Aspects:\n\nAccessibility: Ensure that the materials are accessible, including considerations for individuals with disabilities. This could involve adding alternative text for images, ensuring website compatibility with screen readers, etc.\nFormats: Consider the formats in which the materials will be made available. They should be in formats that are easy to access, use, and adapt.\n\nCommunity and Cultural Sensitivities:\n\nRespect: Be mindful of content that might be culturally sensitive or specific to a certain community. Opening content should be done respectfully and inclusively.\n\n\nAn existing course containing copyrighted readings, lectures notes authored by the teaching team, and - perhaps - student-contributed content would need a thorough evaluation. The copyrighted readings would require permission from the copyright holders or replacements with newly developed or open-access alternatives. The lecture notes could potentially be released under a Creative Commons license if the authors agree. Any student-contributed content would require considerations for privacy and consent before being made openly accessible.\nRetroactively opening existing educational content is a commendable step towards open education, but it comes with its own set of complexities. Balancing legal requirements, ethical considerations, and the goal of openness requires a thorough, nuanced approach. Institutions and educators should engage in careful planning, consultation, and execution to navigate the intellectual property and copyright landscape effectively, ensuring that the opened materials are not only accessible but also legal and ethical in their availability and use."

    "text": "3.2 Some terminology\nCopyright is a law that gives the creator of original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution, typically for a limited time, with the intention of enabling the creator to receive compensation for their creative investment. Copyright applies to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms. These include poems, theses, plays, other literary works, movies, dances, musical compositions, audio recordings, paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, software, radio and television broadcasts, and industrial designs.\nCopyleft is a general method for making a program (or other work) free, and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be free as well. The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public domain, uncopyrighted. But this allows proprietary modifications: anyone can take the code, modify it and sell it as a proprietary product. To prevent this, the copyleft uses copyright law to ensure that every person who receives a copy or derived version of a work can use, modify, and also distribute both the work and derived versions of the work. Copyleft licenses (for software) require that information necessary for reproducing and modifying the work must be made available to recipients of the executable. The source code files will usually contain a copy of the license terms and acknowledge the authors.\nLicense Compatibility is a legal framework that allows for pieces of software with different software licenses to be distributed together. The need for such a framework arises because the different licenses can contain contradictory requirements, rendering it impossible to legally combine source code from separately-licensed software in order to create and publish a new program. License compatibility can be particularly complex with copyleft licenses, which require derivative works to be licensed under a copyleft license. The concept of license compatibility applies to combining or merging software code that is provided under two different software licenses, and can also be a significant issue when trying to combine code placed under a copyleft license with proprietary software.\nAn example of this complexity could be seen when trying to merge code from projects that are under different versions of the GNU General Public License (GPL). They might have requirements that are technically legal to fulfill yet practically difficult for the merged project to adhere to simultaneously.\n\n3.2.1 Examples and Practical Implications:\n\nCopyright: A book author automatically having exclusive rights to their work, meaning others can’t reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works without permission.\nCopyleft: A software developer releasing a program under the GNU GPL, meaning anyone can use, modify, and distribute it, but any derivative work must be released under the same license.\nLicense Compatibility: An open-source project trying to integrate code under both the Apache License and the MIT License, needing to ensure that the terms of both licenses can be satisfied simultaneously.\n\nEach of these terms plays a significant role in how intellectual property, especially software and written works, is managed, distributed, and modified in the real world. This also applies to OER. Understanding them is vital for anyone involved in creating, using, or distributing such works, to ensure legal and ethical compliance as well as widespread usability and accessibility."

    "text": "3.3 Common licenses and organizations\n\n3.3.1 Creative Commons: CC-BY & CC-BY-SA\nCreative Commons (CC) is a non-profit organization that provides free licenses and tools that copyright owners can use to allow others to share, reuse, and remix their material, legally (Creative Commons). CC licenses are a simple way to give permissions for use of copyrighted works, fostering an accessible digital culture.\nCreative Commons licenses are not alternatives to traditional copyright, but rather, they work alongside it. Traditional copyright law inherently restricts the right to copy, distribute, display, and perform protected works, as well as the right to make derivative works. In contrast, Creative Commons licenses help copyright owners grant some of their rights to the public while retaining others through a variety of licensing and contract schemes. Creative Commons licenses facilitate a culture of sharing and adaptation, crucial in open education, where resources are meant to be widely distributed and adapted.\nThere are several important CC licenses that are commonly used in open education:\n\nCC-BY (Attribution): This license allows others to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work and derivative works based upon it, but only if they give the author or licensor the credits in the manner specified by these. This is the most flexible CC license in terms of what others can do with the works.\nCC-BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike): This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon the work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit the author and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to open source software licenses.\nCC-BY-NC-SA (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike): This license allows others to remix, adapt, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as they credit the author and license their new creations under the identical terms. It’s suitable for creators who want to encourage the sharing and adaptation of their works while restricting their use to non-commercial purposes.\n\nEach type of Creative Commons license provides a different level of freedom, catering to a variety of needs for both content creators and users, promoting a collaborative and sharing culture while respecting the rights of the original creators.\n\n\n3.3.2 Applying Creative Commons licenses in open education\nCC licenses are integral in open education, enabling the free use and adaptation of educational materials. For instance, the MIT OpenCourseWare (MIT OCW) project uses a CC-BY-NC-SA license to allow users to freely use, adapt, and share course materials, provided they give appropriate credit, not use them for commercial purposes, and distribute their adaptations under the same license.\nSimilarly, OER Commons (OER Commons) provides a plethora of teaching and learning materials under various CC licenses, granting educators the flexibility to use, adapt, and share resources in compliance with the specified terms.\n\n\n3.3.3 Other relevant organizations and licenses\nAside from Creative Commons licenses, there are other licensing options and frameworks that are relevant to open education and OER. We list three of the most prominent licensing families below.\n\nThe GNU Project is a free software, mass collaboration project with the goal to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices by collaboratively developing and publishing software that gives everyone the rights to freely run the software, copy and distribute it, study it, and modify it. The GNU Project has developed a number of licenses that are commonly used in open science:\n\nGNU General Public License (GPL): This license, commonly used for software, allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute software and software-based works. It requires that any derivative work also be distributed under the same license.\nGNU Free Documentation License (GFDL): Created for manuals, textbooks, and other functional and instructional materials, allowing them to be copied, distributed, and modified provided derivative works are under the same license.\n\nThe Apache Software Foundation is an American nonprofit corporation to support a number of open-source software projects. The foundation is known for its support for the Apache HTTP Server, the world’s most used web server software. The foundation developed the Apache license:\n\nApache License 2.0: A permissive free software license written by the Apache Software Foundation, allowing users to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of the software under the terms of the license.\nEducational Community License 2.0: A modified Apache 2.0 license by the open source initiative that change the scope of the patent grant to be specific to the needs of the education communities using this license. The Educational Community License is specifically crafted for the higher education community. It allows others to use, modify, and distribute educational materials similarly to CC and open source licenses.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology has developed a permissive free software license in the late 1980s\n\nMIT License: A permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It’s a short, simple license allowing users to do anything they want with the material as long as they include the original copyright notice and disclaimers. As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, high license compatibility.\n\n\nUnderstanding the nuances of intellectual property, copyright, and public domain is fundamental to navigating the legal landscape of open education. Creative Commons licenses offer a balanced approach, granting educators and learners the freedom to use, adapt, and share educational materials while respecting the rights of original creators. This dynamic fosters an environment of collaboration, innovation, and accessibility in education, aligning with the ethos of an open, inclusive, and innovative learning culture.\nIncorporate appropriate citations, and ensure that the provided links and resources are thoroughly reviewed and aligned with the specific focus of your chapter and book.

    "text": "4.1 Making it open: Prospective or Retrospective\nEmbracing open education represents a profound shift in the way we create, share, and interact with educational resources. As you embark on this journey, one of the first decisions you’ll encounter is whether to make existing educational materials open (retrospective), start new projects with open education in mind (prospective), or a combination of both.\nEach approach comes with its own set of challenges and rewards. On one hand, opening up existing materials can provide immediate benefits in terms of accessibility and collaboration. On the other hand, this approach can be time-consuming and complex, especially when dealing with issues such as copyright and the technical aspects of transforming existing resources into open formats.\nStarting fresh with open education in mind when developing new materials, however, can often be a more streamlined process. From the outset, you can design your resources to be open, eliminating the need for later adaptations. Yet, this approach may mean that valuable existing resources remain closed off, at least in the short term.\nThe decision between these two approaches is not a binary one. A successful open education initiative often incorporates elements of both strategies. Opening up materials is always a win, but it’s crucial to strike a balance between feasibility, effort, and the eventual result. You might find that while some existing resources lend themselves well to being opened retrospectively, for others, it might be more worthwhile to leave them as they are and focus on incorporating open principles in new projects.\nRemember, the ultimate goal is to improve the accessibility and adaptability of educational resources. Whether you achieve this by opening existing materials or designing new ones with openness in mind will depend on your unique circumstances, resources, and goals. Let’s explore these two approaches in greater detail."

    "section": "4.2 Starting Open Prospectively",
    "text": "4.2 Starting Open Prospectively\nEmbarking on the journey of creating OER is a rewarding endeavor, but like all significant initiatives, it requires structured planning and execution. This process is delineated into four pivotal stages:\n\nPlanning for Openness: This initial stage lays the foundation. It involves understanding the why, what, and for whom you are creating the materials. It’s about aligning your objectives with the needs of your audience and considering the practicalities involved. Information on this stage will be presented in this chapter.\nCreating Content: Once the groundwork is established, the focus shifts to the content. This stage is dedicated to crafting high-quality, accessible, and engaging materials. It encompasses not just the creation, but also the considerations of format, adaptability, and inclusivity. In Chapter 4 more details on this stage can be found.\nLaunch and Implementation: Here, the prepared materials are introduced to the world. This phase involves selecting the right platform, ensuring easy access for your target audience, and setting up mechanisms for feedback and interaction. For this, you need to work with the right resources, details on which can be found in Chapter 7.\nLeveraging Benefits: The final stage revolves around the post-launch period. It’s about amplifying the advantages of open materials, such as promoting educational equity, sharing your work with a broader audience, and fostering community collaboration. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement based on feedback and evolving educational trends. See Chapter 8 for more information.\n\nFor each of these stages, we will delve into specific phases, breaking them down to offer a comprehensive understanding. For every phase, actionable steps will be outlined to guide you seamlessly through the process of starting open prospectively.\nPrepare to embark on a fulfilling journey that not only enhances educational access but also fosters a culture of collaboration and continuous learning.\n\n4.2.1 Planning for Openness: Scoping\nWhen starting to think about creating OER, scoping is a first foundational step. This section will guide you in defining your objectives and gaining insights into your learners’ needs, ensuring that your OER will be both purposeful and effectively tailored.\nSetting clear goals  Setting goals and having a clear sense of direction is crucial when embarking on a journey to create OER. What do you hope to achieve by making your educational materials open? Is it to increase (free) access to quality education, promote collaboration among learners, or adapt to diverse learning needs and styles? Having a clear understanding of your goals will guide your decisions throughout the project and help you measure your success.\nUnderstanding your audience  Understanding your audience will heavily influence the design and presentation of your OER. Who are your learners? What are their learning needs and preferences? How tech-savvy are they? What languages do they speak? Do they have specific accessibility needs? An understanding of your audience will ensure that your OER are relevant, useful, and accessible to those who need them.\nSetting clear goals and understanding your audience might require some research and reflection, but it’s worth the effort. These two aspects form the foundation upon which successful open education projects are built. In this section we help you to clarify your goals by means of asking you scoping questions. They ensure that your project stays focused, meets learners’ needs, and achieves its intended impact. So before you delve into the details of creating OER, take some time to outline your goals and understand your audience, Exercise 4.1 can help you. It’s your first step towards a successful open education project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.1 (Scoping questions for goals and target audience)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYour Answers\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve by making your educational materials open?\n\n\n\nWho are your learners?\n\n\n\nWhat are their learning needs and preferences?\n\n\n\nHow tech-savvy are your learners?\n\n\n\nWhat languages do your learners speak?\n\n\n\nDo your learners have specific accessibility needs?\n\n\n\nAre there assignments?\n\n\n\nDo learners need to hand-in work? Or can it done online?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder management  Stakeholders play a pivotal role in the success of any open education initiative. Their buy-in, or the extent to which they support and are committed to the project, can significantly influence its implementation and sustainability. When considering an open education initiative, it’s essential to ensure that all key stakeholders, whether they be faculty, administration, and potentially students, are not only informed but also involved in the design process. Their unique perspectives, concerns, and insights can provide valuable feedback that can shape the direction and quality of the project. Additionally, their support can help to ensure longevity and sustainability of the project.\nHowever, along with the advantages of involving stakeholders comes the task of anticipating and navigating potential challenges and barriers. Resistance might arise from educators who are unfamiliar with or skeptical about the benefits of open education. Some learners might prefer traditional learning materials or have concerns about teaching in the open. By creating OER, you put yourself out there and become vulnerable to criticism. You might receive feedback about the quality and relevance of your materials. Try to convince yourself and others that this is desirable, because in the long-run it will improve the quality of your materials. To help you with stakeholder management, you can use Exercise 4.2 to consider each group of stakeholders and strategize on how best to involve them in your open education journey. Additionally, Section 2.5 and Section 2.6 provide some overviews of (perceived) augments for and against open education to help you in discussing open education with stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.2 (Stakeholder Engagement and Concerns Evaluation)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for Stakeholder Consideration\nYour Answers\n\n\n\n\nWho are the relevant stakeholders for your open education initiative?\n\n\n\nWhich stakeholders might view the initiative positively? Why?\n\n\n\nWhich stakeholders might view the initiative negatively? Why?\n\n\n\nWhat specific concerns can you address or alleviate?\n\n\n\nWhat concerns might remain even after addressing them?\n\n\n\nHow do you plan to address or mitigate these remaining concerns?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of success  Before we turn to the practicalities in our planning stage, we should determine when we would consider the first version of our open educational initiative a success. Success can be measured in various ways, and it’s crucial to have clear metrics in place from the outset. Quantitative metrics, such as the number of users or downloads, can provide tangible evidence of the reach and uptake of your materials. For example, achieving a certain number of users within the first month of launch might be a benchmark for success, but perhaps not relevant if you develop the materials for a course with a fixed number of students. Qualitative measures can shed light on the actual impact and effectiveness of your materials. Feedback from users, testimonials, and direct observations can offer insights into how well the materials are meeting the needs of the learners. Did they find the resources engaging? Were the materials able to cater to diverse learning needs? These qualitative insights can guide future iterations, ensuring that the OER continue to evolve and improve based on real-world feedback. Be gentle for yourself and don’t expect to get everything right in the first iteration. But do consider what if important to you and your stakeholders and how you can measure that. Exercise 4.3 can help you to ask what you consider important, Example 4.4 provides examples of how you can measure or investigate success.\nDoes it all feel like a bit much to keep track of? Don’t worry, in Figure 4.1 you can find back the steps that have been described. Additionally, the Figure will be updated after each relevant section such that, step by step, the sequence of actions to create OER will be mapped.\n\n\n\n\n\ntimeline\n  title Starting Open Prospectively\n  section Planning for Openness\n    Scoping : Setting clear goals\n           : Understanding your audience\n           : Stakeholder management\n           : Evaluation of success\n    ... : ...\n  section Content\n    ... : ...\n  section Launch and Implementation\n    ... : ...\n  section Leveraging Benefits\n    ... : ...\n\n                      \n\n\nFigure 4.1: Mapping the actions that need to be taken to create OER prospectively.

Every educational venture, open or otherwise, comes with its unique set of challenges. Open education, however, introduces its own nuances. From understanding the resources you need to committing the right amount of time, from developing a seamless content creation workflow to addressing copyright concerns, there’s a lot to consider. This section aims to provide a guide on how to approach these facets, ensuring your OER not only reach their intended audience but also are able to be updated and can stay relevant.\nThe heart of an open education initiative is not just the content, but also the entire ecosystem around it. This ecosystem includes the tools you use, the platform on which you share materials, the licenses under which you operate, the community you engage, and the feedback loops you establish. Each of these elements requires careful thought and planning. In this section, we’ll delve deep into each of these aspects, offering both advice and actionable steps. Whether it’s ensuring every learner can access your materials regardless of their abilities, or fostering a vibrant community that actively uses and contributes to your resources, our goal is to prepare you for every eventuality. So, let’s embark on this detailed exploration of the practicalities of open education.\nResource and Time Commitment  Preparation is extremely important. Creating new materials is a timely process, and it’s important to be realistic about the time and resources you have available. Although in Section 2.5 we mention that OERs can reduce cost for students, creating the materials can be costly. We need to understand the resources we have available and how we can use them effectively.\nEvery initiative, regardless of its scale, requires some form of financial investment. It could be for the design and hosting of a platform, compensation for contributors, investment in technology, or promotion of the materials. Start by estimating a budget for each phase of your project. Consider all potential costs and try to anticipate unexpected expenses. Always allocate a contingency fund, as unexpected costs can and will arise. Be clear about the time you and your team can dedicate to the project as a result of the budget. This includes content creation, reviewing, updating, community engagement, and addressing feedback. Allocate sufficient time for each phase, keeping in mind that some phases may overlap or take longer than anticipated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of a budget\n\n\n\n Do we have one lying around that we can share? Or create a ficitve one.  \n\n\nLicensing  Picking a license is not something most people will enjoy doing, but it is important to do so. It has consequences for the way you can use the material in future, and the way others can use it. Chapter 3 is fully devoted to providing you with more information on this topic. But here we want to stress the importance of choosing a license. It is one of the most important practical steps if you plan for OER. For instance, it is important to be consistent in the way you license your material. If you use different licenses for different parts of your materials, it will be difficult for others to use them. Consider if you need credits if others use your materials. Can they change it? Can they use it commercially? These are all questions that you need to answer before you can choose a license. Section 3.4 points you to resources that can help you to answer these questions and pick the correct licence for your materials. We hope that by listing the licencing issue here in your practical steps, each time you go through the cycle of starting to plan for OER and you use this book, you will be reminded in the early stages of the process.\nPlatform and Content  Deciding on platform and content cannot fully be seen as independent from each other. If you decide to use certain content types, e.g. videos, PowerPoint, PDFs, you will need to consider the platform that can host these content types. If you already chose a platform, you will need to consider the content types that can be hosted on the platform you choose. Can you make it work? If not, you will need to reconsider either the platform or the content types. Chapter 7 helps you with some practical options to choose your resources and Chapter 10 shows examples of how others have done it. There will be many more options out there that we do not describe, so feel free to explore and find what works for you. The planning stage is however the stage to make these decisions. When selecting platforms and content types for open educational resources, key considerations include the content creation workflow, encompassing quality control and collaboration methods; distribution and outreach strategies for sharing materials, and ensuring accessibility for all learners. Additionally, maybe you want to fostering engagement, collect feedback, or have iterative improvement of materials. We developed Exercise 4.5 to help you think about the content types you want to use and Exercise 4.7 to help you think about the platform you want to use.\nTo help you keep track of all the steps, we update our mapping in Figure 4.2. Here you can find back the steps that have been described up to this point.\n\n\n\n\n\ntimeline\n  title Starting Open Prospectively\n  section Planning for Openness\n    Scoping : Setting clear goals\n           : Understanding your audience\n           : Stakeholder management\n           : Evaluation of success\n    Practicalities : Resources and time commitment\n                   : Licensing\n                   : Platform and content\n  section Content\n    ... : ...\n  section Launch and Implementation\n    ... : ...\n  section Leveraging Benefits\n    ... : ...\n\n                      \n\n\nFigure 4.2: Mapping the actions that need to be taken to create OER prospectively.

    "text": "4.3 Making it Open Retrospectively\nWhen you want to open up existing resources, you might feel like you have a head start because you already have materials. However, in practice, this does not always mean that the process is easier. To guide you through the process of making existing resources open, we will use slightly different steps than we did for creating new OER. The first two steps of the process differ from the steps we described in Section 4.2. The last two steps are more or less the same and differences will be adressed once we get there.\n\nEvaluating Existing Resources  Where in creating new OER we start with scoping out our plans, in making existing resources open we start with evaluating existing resources. This is because you need to know what you have before you can decide what you want to do with it. Additionally, we have to start immediately with the issue of licencing. In Chapter 3 we provide an introduction to licencing. When making existing resources open, licencing becomes the first issue to deal with before we can continue. In this Chapter, the Evaluation of Existing Resources is discussed in more detail.\nRevision and Adaptation  Once you have evaluated your existing resources, you can start to think about how you want to make them open and what changes need to be made. In Chapter 6 we provide some considerations for updating content. We also give some practical tips.\nLaunch and Implementation: Here, the prepared materials are introduced to the world. This phase involves selecting the right platform, ensuring easy access for your target audience, and setting up mechanisms for feedback and interaction. For this, you need to work with the right resources, details on which can be found in Chapter 7.\nLeveraging Benefits: The final stage revolves around the post-launch period. It’s about amplifying the advantages of open materials, such as promoting educational equity, sharing your work with a broader audience, and fostering community collaboration. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement based on feedback and evolving educational trends. See Chapter 8 for more information.\n\n\n4.3.1 Evaluating Existing Resources\nOpening up existing resources can be more difficult then creating new ones because you have to deal with existing materials that might not be in the right format, or that are not licensed in a way that allows you to make them open. Or maybe you have to deal with the fact that you have not kept track of the sources of your materials, and you do not know if you are allowed to make them open. Maybe you need to deal with someone who developed part of the materials before you took over the course. When starting to open up existing resources, the two big things to take care of are licencing and stakeholder management.\nLicencing \nWhen you want to open up existing resources, you need to make sure that you have the right to do so. This means that you need to know what the current licencing situation is. You need to know if you are allowed to make the materials open, and if so, under what conditions. If you are not allowed to make the materials open, you need to find out if you can get permission to do so. If you cannot get permission, you need to find alternatives or only partially open up the materials. Perhaps it is not immediately clear what the licence currently is. In that case, you may need to reviewing course materials, check with content creators, or consult institutional policies. In short, the first step is to identify the current licencing situation(s) and understand restrictions and permissions. Example 4.7 shows how you could map the existing situation.\nOnce the current situation is mapped, compatibility of the licences with each other and with your goals has to be assessed. Is it feasible to re-license the materials? If not, what are the alternatives? If it is feasible, what are the implications? What will the new licence be? Are you okay with using that licence or will you drop some of the more restrictive materials and create new materials in their place? Finally, do you want all materials to have the same licence or are you okay with different licences for different materials? The latter complicates things for any next iteration of the materials, but might be necessary if you cannot get permission to re-license some of the materials. In short, the second step is to review the compatibility of licences and develop strategies for materials with restrictive licences. Finally, it would be good if you at least mention the issue of consistency in licensing and even better if you keep a detailed record of all licensing decisions and justifications. This ensures transparency in licensing for end-users and potential collaborators. You could, for instance, keep these notes in a readme file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.7 (Example Mapping the Current Situation)  \n\n\n\n\nslides class 1\nslides class 2\nExercises\nVideos\nSoftware\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Licence\nCC-BY\nCC-BY\nCC-BY-SA\nCC-BY-NC-SA\nMIT\n\n\nAllows sharing\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nAllows adaptation\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nAllows commercial use\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\n\nShare Alike\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nAttribution\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder Management \nWhen you want to open up existing resources, you need to make sure that you have the support of all stakeholders. This means that you need to know who the stakeholders are, what their interests are, and what their influence is. For instance, who was the original creator of the materials. What is your institutions view on opening up materials that were designed by their employees. Does your employer agree that you open up the materials? If not, what are the alternatives? First, identify all stakeholders and understand their interests and influence. Once you have done that, get their buy-in. Communicate your plan of opening up the materials and address any concerns they might have. Try to navigate resistance by identifying potential sources of resistance before you start the conversations. Prepare strategies to overcome skepticism or objections. Address both the benefits and concerns that stakeholders might have, Chapter 2 can help you with both.\nHopefully your stakeholders are as enthusiastic as you are, or at least allow you to start opening up. Ideally stakeholders become active participants in the decision-making process. For instance, in deciding on the licences that should be used in your institutions views. Whether or not they become active participants, it is good to keep them informed throughout the process. What is the progress and what were the final results. Where can the open materials be found and how can they be shared.\nFinally, it is good to keep a record of all communications with stakeholders. This ensures that you will not get into trouble later on if someone claims that they did not agree to opening up the materials. when opening up existing materials, you need to be more careful to avoid any issues down the line. To help you keep track of all the steps you need to take, we have created mapping that you can use to make sure you do not forget anything, see Figure 6.1. The Figure will be updated after each relevant section such that, step by step, the sequence of actions to make resources open will be mapped.\n\n\n\n\n\ntimeline\n  title Opening Up Existing Educational Materials\n  section Planning for Openness\n    Evaluating Existing Resources : Licencing\n                            : Stakeholder Management\n  section Content\n    ... : ...\n  section Launch and Implementation\n    ... : ...\n  section Leveraging Benefits\n    ... : ...\n   \n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Mapping the actions that need to be taken to make resources open retrospectively.

When crafting OER with an open approach, it’s crucial to embed the ethos of openness into every aspect of the creation process. This means not only making your content freely accessible but also ensuring it resonates with a broad and diverse audience and adheres to idea of transparency, inclusivity and accessibility. It is optimal to design content that accommodates a wide range of learners, including those with disabilities. Here are some suggestions you can keep in mind when designing content:\n\nUniversal Design for Learning (UDL): Adopt UDL principles to create materials that offer multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression. This approach ensures that learning experiences are accessible and meaningful for all students, regardless of their learning style or ability. For more information, see the UDL guidelines here (CAST 2018).\nCultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural diversity in your content. This includes using inclusive language, examples, and illustrations that reflect a variety of backgrounds and experiences. Avoid cultural biases and stereotypes to ensure your content is welcoming and relatable to a broad audience.\nTechnology and Formats: Choose formats that are widely accessible. For instance, while videos can be engaging, they should be complemented with captions or transcripts for learners with hearing impairments. Similarly, text materials should be screen-reader friendly, and interactive tools should be navigable for users with different abilities. When designing figures, consider using color-blind friendly palettes and patterns.\n\nThese suggestions to content creation not only aligns with the philosophy of open education, they also enhances the overall quality and impact of the educational materials. Your work will be more accessible, more engaging, and more relevant to a broader audience."

    "text": "5.2 Testing\nBeing open is not just about making content available, it is also about making sure that the content is accessible and usable. Just putting content online is not enough. You want to know that people can actually use the content of your OER after putting in all that effort to create them. Ensuring that your open educational resources function effectively across various platforms and technologies is what we can call the “Testing” phase. The testing is meant to assess the technical robustness and user accessibility of your content. Here are some key areas to focus on:\n\n5.2.1 Technical Compatibility\n\nCross-Device Accessibility: Test whether your content can be accessed across different devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers.\nOperating System Compatibility: Ensure that the content functions well on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.\nBrowser Compatibility: Verify that your content displays correctly in various web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.\nScreen Size Adaptability: Test how your content adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring readability and usability across devices.\nInternet connection Speed: Ensure that your content loads efficiently even on slower connections, which is crucial for users in regions with limited bandwidth. For instance, optimize image and video sizes without compromising quality. The Google PageSpeed Insights tool can be helpful in analyzing page load times and offering optimization suggestions.\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Load Testing\n\nHandling High Traffic: If your content is hosted online, conduct load testing to ensure that your server can handle high traffic without significant performance issues. Or in any case, figure out if you can handle the demand of the amount of students you have. We can assure you from personal experience that it is not fun to have servers crash because too many people are trying to access your content at the same time in your classroom. This can be a real shame of the time spent on developing the content.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Iterative Approach\nTreat testing as an ongoing process of continuous improvement. Use the feedback and data collected to make continuous improvements, enhancing the accessibility, usability, and overall quality of your content.\n\nFeedback from Actual Users: Collect feedback from a group of test users representing your target audience. Or collect feedback during actual usage. This can provide valuable insights into the usability, engagement level, and overall learner experience.\nEase of Navigation: Assess how easy it is for users to find and navigate through the content. Ensure that navigation elements are intuitive and user-friendly.\nAccessibility: Ensure that your OER are fully accessible to learners with disabilities. This includes checking for screen reader compatibility, ensuring proper color contrast, and providing captions or transcripts for videos. Utilize a tool like WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool) to evaluate your content for accessibility compliance.\n\nBy rigorously testing your OER, you not only enhance its technical quality but also ensure a more pleasant and effective learning experience for all users."

    "text": "5.3 Prepare for the Future\nCreating open educational resources (OER) is not just about addressing current educational needs; it’s also about building resources that can evolve and remain relevant over time. As you develop your OER, it’s essential to consider how they will be maintained, updated, and used in the future. Here are some strategies to ensure your content remains valuable and adaptable for years to come:\n\n5.3.1 Designing for Adaptability\n\nModular Design: Create your content in modular segments that can be easily updated or reorganized. This approach allows for easier revisions and additions without needing to overhaul the entire resource. Most educational resources will naturally follow such a modular design. But make sure that, for instance, cross references are adaptive to changes in the content.\nSoftware use: Try to avoid proprietary software that may become inaccessible in the future. For instance, if you use a proprietary software to create your content, make sure that you can export your work to a standard format that can be used with other software. This is especially important for editable files like documents, images, and videos. Realize that future you might not have access to licences for the software you used to create your content. Additionally, consider any software that your students might need to use. Students might have access to software through their university. But once they graduate, they might not have access to the software anymore. In these cases, consider using Open Source Software.\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Files and Formats\n\nPreserve Source Materials: Always keep the raw, editable files of your content, not just the final published versions. For instance, maintain the original editable files for documents, images, and videos.\nVersion Control: Use version control systems like Git and platforms like GitHub or GitLab to track changes and manage updates to your content. This is especially useful for collaborative projects. See also Chapter 7.\nFormat Considerations: Choose file formats that are widely used and likely to be supported in the long term. For example, standard formats like HTML, PDF, and MP4 are more likely to be accessible and usable in the future compared to proprietary formats.\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Feedback and Update Mechanism\n\nFeedback Channels: Establish clear channels for users to provide feedback on your resources. This can be through online forms, email, or within the learning platform itself. This feedback can be used to inform future updates and revisions.\nRegular Review and Update Cycles: Set a schedule for regularly reviewing and updating your content. This ensures that your materials stay up-to-date with the latest information and educational practices. Usually this is a natural cycle for educational resources. But it is important to be aware of this cycle and to plan time to update.\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Community Involvement\n\nEncourage Community Contributions: Foster a community around your OER where educators, learners, and other stakeholders can contribute to the content’s development and refinement.\nCollaboration Platforms: Consider utilizing platforms that allow for collaborative contributions and discussions, such as wikis or community forums.\nOpen Licenses: Use open licenses that allow others to use, adapt, and redistribute your content. This encourages community involvement and allows for the creation of derivative works. See also Chapter 3.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you do everything you can to ensure that your OER remain valuable, relevant, and accessible for years to come. Preparing for the future is about building flexibility into your resources and fostering a culture of continuous improvement and community engagement.\nTo help you keep track of all the steps, we update our mapping in Figure 5.1.

    "text": "7.1 Github\nGitHub is a powerful and versatile platform, transcending its traditional role as a hub for software development. At its core, GitHub is a web-based interface that utilizes Git, a version control system allowing multiple people to work together on projects. This functionality of GitHub is not limited to code; it extends seamlessly into the development and management of open educational resources.\nThe true strength of GitHub lies in its collaborative nature. Developers, educators and students can jointly create, modify, and enhance software code, course materials, textbooks, and other educational and non-educational resources. This process is facilitated by GitHub’s intuitive features like ‘forking’, where users can make their own copy of a project to modify, and ‘pull requests’, which allow them to suggest changes to the original project. These features encourage a community-driven approach to development and education, where knowledge is not just consumed but actively constructed and refined by its users.\nGitHub’s version control capabilities are equally useful in an educational context. Educators can track and manage changes to materials over time, ensuring that resources are continually updated and improved. This aspect fosters a dynamic educational environment where content evolves in response to new information, pedagogical strategies, and user feedback.\nMoreover, GitHub hosts a plethora of diverse educational content, offering an expansive resource pool for educators and students. The platform’s open nature aligns perfectly with the ethos of open science and open education, providing unrestricted access to a wide array of learning materials. Whether it’s programming tutorials, scientific research, or entire course curricula, GitHub serves as a one-stop shop for educational resources.\nA notable initiative by GitHub in the education sector is GitHub Education (https://education.github.com/). This program provides students and educators with free access to the best developer tools in one place, along with opportunities to learn and collaborate. It’s a valuable resource for those looking to integrate technology and collaboration in their teaching and learning processes. GitHub Education offers various benefits like free access to GitHub Enterprise or Team plans, automation tools, continuous integration, cloud hosting services, and more, all of which are pivotal in creating an interactive and engaging learning environment.\nBy leveraging GitHub in the educational context, educators and institutions can break away from traditional, siloed approaches to teaching.

    "text": "8.1 Zenodo\nZenodo is a general-purpose open repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN. It was launched in May 2013 as a means for researchers in various fields to comply with open science deposit requirements, especially in the absence of an institutional repository. Zenodo allows researchers to deposit a wide array of research-related digital artifacts, including research papers, data sets, research software, and reports. Each submission is assigned a persistent digital object identifier (DOI), facilitating easy citation of the stored items.\nZenodo reported significant milestones, such as hosting over 1 petabyte of data and receiving 15 million yearly visits.\nZenodo’s approach to Open Science is inclusive and barrier-free, with no requirements on format, size, access restrictions, or license for submissions. This makes it an effective platform for sharing, curating, and publishing data and software for researchers worldwide. Furthermore, Zenodo’s simple web interface is complemented by a rich API, allowing for third-party tools and services to integrate with it as part of their workflow. One of its key features is its integration with GitHub repositories.\nFor Open Science, Zenodo helps researchers receive credit by making results citable and integrates them into existing reporting lines to funding agencies like the European Commission. Zenodo’s metadata is openly available under a CC0 license, and its open content is accessible through open APIs. The repository is a concrete alternative to commercial services, aiming to serve as a viable solution for current and future generations in the scholarly communication landscape.\n\n8.1.1 Starting a Zenodo repository\nZenodo enables to share and preserve your digital research objects (publications, data, software, presentations, etc.) in three simple steps:\n\nUpload: Upload the files you want to share.\nDescribe: Describe the files with minimal metadata such as title and creators.\nPublish: When ready, hit the publish button to share your research.\n\nOnce you publish, Zenodo will automatically assign a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to your record. Your research output will be findable and citable immediately. Zenodo provides a straightforward and user-friendly outline of this procedure in its documentation.\n\n\n8.1.2 Zenodo and GitHub\nReferencing and citing content for scientific purposes on GitHub is not straightforward. GitHub is a code repository, not a publishing platform. GitHub does not provide a DOI for repositories, and the only way to cite a GitHub repository is to use the URL. However, the URL is not persistent, and the content of the repository can change over time. Zenodo provides a solution to this problem by integrating with GitHub. Zenodo can create a snapshot of a GitHub repository and assign a DOI to it. This DOI can then be used to cite the repository. This process is clearly outlined in the Zenodo documentation and GitHub documentation"

The hosting part can be done by other platforms, such as Zenodo, OSF, GitHub or Surfsharekit (see Chapter 7)\nOne of the key features of Edusources is its extensive repository of digital learning materials. The platform offers more than 10,000 learning resources contributed by subject teachers and educational communities. These resources encompass a diverse range of materials including knowledge clips, PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, online modules, and practice tests. The platform’s design not only facilitates the discovery of these resources but also encourages educators to contribute their own materials, thereby continually enhancing the quality and variety of the collection."
