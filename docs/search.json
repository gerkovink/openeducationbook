    "text": "3.1 Making it open: Prospective or Retrospective\nEmbracing open education represents a profound shift in the way we create, share, and interact with educational resources. As you embark on this journey, one of the first decisions you’ll encounter is whether to make existing educational materials open (retrospective), start new projects with open education in mind (prospective), or a combination of both.\nEach approach comes with its own set of challenges and rewards. On one hand, opening up existing materials can provide immediate benefits in terms of accessibility and collaboration. On the other hand, this approach can be time-consuming and complex, especially when dealing with issues such as copyright and the technical aspects of transforming existing resources into open formats.\nStarting fresh with open education in mind when developing new materials, however, can often be a more streamlined process. From the outset, you can design your resources to be open, eliminating the need for later adaptations. Yet, this approach may mean that valuable existing resources remain closed off, at least in the short term.\nThe decision between these two approaches is not a binary one. A successful open education initiative often incorporates elements of both strategies. Opening up materials is always a win, but it’s crucial to strike a balance between feasibility, effort, and the eventual result. You might find that while some existing resources lend themselves well to being opened retrospectively, for others, it might be more worthwhile to leave them as they are and focus on incorporating open principles in new projects.\nRemember, the ultimate goal is to improve the accessibility and adaptability of educational resources. Whether you achieve this by opening existing materials or designing new ones with openness in mind will depend on your unique circumstances, resources, and goals. Let’s explore these two approaches in greater detail.\n\n3.1.1 Starting Open Prospectively\nEmbarking on the journey of creating open educational materials is a rewarding endeavor, but like all significant initiatives, it requires structured planning and execution. This process is delineated into four pivotal stages:\n\nPlanning for Openness: This initial stage lays the foundation. It involves understanding the why, what, and for whom you are creating the materials. It’s about aligning your objectives with the needs of your audience and considering the practicalities involved. Information on this stage will be presented in this chapter.\nCreating Content: Once the groundwork is established, the focus shifts to the content. This stage is dedicated to crafting high-quality, accessible, and engaging materials. It encompasses not just the creation, but also the considerations of format, adaptability, and inclusivity. In ?sec-creating_content more details on this stage can be found.\nLaunch and Implementation: Here, the prepared materials are introduced to the world. This phase involves selecting the right platform, ensuring easy access for your target audience, and setting up mechanisms for feedback and interaction. For this, you need to work with the right resources, details on which can be found in Chapter 6.\nLeveraging Benefits: The final stage revolves around the post-launch period. It’s about amplifying the advantages of open materials, such as promoting educational equity, sharing your work with a broader audience, and fostering community collaboration. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement based on feedback and evolving educational trends. See Chapter 7 for more information.\n\nFor each of these stages, we will delve into specific phases, breaking them down to offer a comprehensive understanding. For every phase, actionable steps will be outlined to guide you seamlessly through the process of starting open prospectively.\nPrepare to embark on a fulfilling journey that not only enhances educational access but also fosters a culture of collaboration and continuous learning.\n\n\n\n3.1.1.1 Planning for Openness\n\n3.1.1.1.1 Scoping\nWhen embarking on a journey to create open educational materials, having a clear sense of direction is crucial. This starts with setting clear goals for your open education project. What do you hope to achieve by making your educational materials open? Is it to increase (free) access to quality education, promote collaboration among learners, or adapt to diverse learning needs and styles? Having a clear understanding of your goals will guide your decisions throughout the project and help you measure your success.\nAt the same time, you should also seek to understand your audience, as this will heavily influence the design and presentation of your open educational materials. Who are your learners? What are their learning needs and preferences? How tech-savvy are they? What languages do they speak? Do they have specific accessibility needs? An understanding of your audience will ensure that your open educational materials are relevant, useful, and accessible to those who need them.\nSetting clear goals and understanding your audience might require some research and reflection, but it’s worth the effort. These two aspects form the foundation upon which successful open education projects are built. In this section we help you to clarify your goals by means of asking you scoping questions. They ensure that your project stays focused, meets learners’ needs, and achieves its intended impact. So before you delve into the details of creating open educational materials, take some time to outline your goals and understand your audience, Table 3.1 can help you. It’s your first step towards a successful open education project.\n\n\nTable 3.1: Scoping questions for goals and target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYour Answers\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve by making your educational materials open?\n\n\n\nWho are your learners?\n\n\n\nWhat are their learning needs and preferences?\n\n\n\nHow tech-savvy are your learners?\n\n\n\nWhat languages do your learners speak?\n\n\n\nDo your learners have specific accessibility needs?\n\n\n\nAre there assignments?\n\n\n\nDo learners need to hand-in work? Or can it done online?\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you thought about your goals and target audience, the next step is choosing the right format and platform that suits your needs. In the realm of open education, choosing the appropriate format and platform for your materials is a decision of paramount importance. This choice influences how accessible, adaptable, and collaborative your resources will be.\nFormat pertains to the type of file or medium you’ll use to present your content. For instance, while a PDF might be universally readable, it’s not as editable as a Markdown or an Office document. Likewise, video materials may be engaging, but they might pose accessibility challenges without accompanying transcripts. Table 3.2 is meant to help you think though your choices. You can fill it out for each of your educational materials and start considering if you are using the right formats.\n\n\nTable 3.2: Considerations for Choosing Format and Platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYour Answers\n\n\n\n\nWhich educational format will you be using? (e.g., videos, text, interactive exercises)\n\n\n\nHow frequently do you anticipate updates to the material?\n\n\n\nWill there be collaboration with others in content creation or revision?\n\n\n\nIs feedback from users/learners desirable?\n\n\n\nAre there any other specific technical requirements or considerations for your materials?\n\n\n\nDo the materials need to be editable?\n\n\n\nWhat file formats will you be sharing information in? (e.g., PDF, Powerpoint, Markdown, Jupyter Notebook) Are these formats able to handle the your goals above?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform, on the other hand, is about where and how you host and share your content. The platform dictates how learners access your materials, how they interact with them, and how they collaborate or contribute. While we’ll dive deeper into concrete options for platforms in Chapter 6, it’s essential to reflect on a few questions when starting to think about designing open materials. A well-chosen format and platform can enhance the openness, reach, and impact of your educational materials, ensuring they resonate with and benefit your intended audience. But how far can, and do you want, to go. For now, we will leave you with a few questions to consider in Table 3.3\n\n\nTable 3.3: Platform Choice Considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYour Answers\n\n\n\n\nAre you allowed to use any platform you choose for your course?\n\n\n\nHow interactive do you want the learning experience to be?\n\n\n\nDo you want interactions with students to be open and visible to the whole world?\n\n\n\nDo you want assignments and student submissions to be public?\n\n\n\nWhat tech tools are your target audience familiar with?\n\n\n\nIs community collaboration in content creation a goal?\n\n\n\nDo you want insight into the collaboration between students?\n\n\n\nWhat kind of analytics or feedback mechanisms are you seeking?\n\n\n\nWould you like to see contributions in group assignments?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource and Time Commitment: For any open education initiative, understanding the resources at your disposal is critical. This includes time, budget, technical expertise, and other support mechanisms.\nStakeholder Buy-in: Is everyone on board with the open education initiative? If there are multiple stakeholders (faculty, administration, etc.), have their concerns and inputs been considered?\nEvaluation Metrics: How will you measure the success of your open education initiative? While some metrics (like the number of users) are quantitative, others might be qualitative, like feedback or testimonials.\nChallenges & Barriers: Anticipate potential challenges. For example, will there be resistance from some educators or learners? What about technical challenges?\n\nDoes it all feel like a bit much to keep track of? Don’t worry, in Figure 3.1 you can find back the steps that have been described. Additionally, the figure will be updated after each relevant section such that, step by step, the sequence of actions to create open educational materials will be mapped.\n\n\n\n\n\ntimeline\n  title Starting Open Prospectively\n  section Planning for Openness\n    Scoping : Goals Setting\n           : Understanding Audience\n           : Format Selection\n           : Platform Consideration\n           : Resource Assessment\n           : Stakeholder Buy-in\n           : Evaluation Metrics\n           : Anticipate Challenges\n    ... : ...\n  section Creating content\n    ... : ...\n    ... : ...\n  section Launch and Implementation\n    ... : ...\n    ... : ...\n  section Leveraging Benefits\n    ... : ...\n    ... : ...\n\n                      \n\n\nFigure 3.1: Mapping the actions that need to be taken to create open educational materials prospectively.

    "text": "2.1 Core Principles\nOpen education is anchored in the belief that education is a universal right. It denotes a dynamic, learner-centric approach to education that seeks to remove barriers to learning and promote equal access to knowledge. Open educational practices are rooted in inclusivity, collaboration, and a focus on improving quality and learner outcomes.\nOpen Educational Resources (OER) play a pivotal role in the open educational paradigm. OER are defined as teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an an open license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others source: Creative Commons. They can include full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge."

    "section": "2.2 The Pedagogical Foundation",
    "text": "2.2 The Pedagogical Foundation\nAt the heart of open education lies an enhanced pedagogical ethos that is inherently flexible and diverse, accommodating a variety of learning styles and needs. This ethos aligns with the constructivist learning theory, where learning is an active, constructive process, and learners are encouraged to construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world, through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences (Brunner 1966). Constructivist learning theory aligns closely with the principles of open education in at least the following waysvarious ways:\n\nAccessibility and Flexibility: Both constructivist learning and open education emphasize the importance of making learning accessible and flexible, catering to diverse learning styles and needs.\nCollaboration and Sharing: Open education promotes the sharing and collaboration of knowledge and resources, echoing the social, interactive aspect of constructivist learning.\nLearner Autonomy: Just as constructivist learning puts the learner at the center of the education process, open education empowers learners by giving them access to a plethora of resources to explore, adapt, and create knowledge.\nReal-world Application: Open education often involves real-world, practical examples and applications, mirroring the constructivist principle of learning being rooted in real-world contexts.\nInnovation in Teaching: Both paradigms encourage innovation in teaching and learning practices, moving away from traditional, didactic methods to more interactive, engaging, and personalized approaches.\n\nWhile constructivist learning continues to be influential - platforms like Khan Academy, Coursera, and edX are embedded with constructivist principles, promoting interactive, self-paced learning - it’s not without its critiques. Challenges include the effective assessment of learning, the need for well-prepared expert educators, and ensuring that foundational knowledge is adequately imparted. Balancing constructivist approaches with direct instructional methods - i.e. a more teacher-centered approach where the teacher directs the learning process, giving clear, explicit, and straightforward instructions to students where necessary - is an ongoing conversation in the educational community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: MIT OpenCourseWare\n\n\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare (MIT OCW) stands as a beacon in the landscape of open education. Initiated in 2001, this ambitious project made virtually all MIT course content available online, free of charge, to any user anywhere in the world. The initiative encapsulates the essence of open education by offering a wealth of learning materials, including lecture notes, exams, and videos to educators, students, and self-learners to use and repurpose for non-commercial purposes under a Creative Commons license.\nMIT OCW exemplifies the transformative power of open education. Nowadays, it includes thousands of courses and has received billions of pageviews from learners and educators in virtually every country, proving the scalability and global reach of open educational practices."

    "text": "2.4 A Holistic Approach to Open Education\nOpen education, in its most transformative sense, extends far beyond the provision of open access to textbooks and course materials. It represents a fundamental shift in how education is designed, delivered, and experienced. A holistic approach to open education sees it not merely as a means of content dissemination but as a dynamic ecosystem that fosters the collaborative creation, adaptation, and sharing of knowledge (Cronin 2017).\nThis educational paradigm champions the integration of open principles into every aspect of the educational journey. From the creation of content and curriculum to the enactment of pedagogical strategies and the assessment of learning, open education is characterized by transparency, adaptability, collaboration, and inclusivity.\nOpen pedagogy, for instance, empowers educators and learners to become co-creators of knowledge. It encourages innovative teaching and learning practices that transcend traditional classroom walls, leveraging open technologies and platforms to facilitate interaction, engagement, and shared learning experiences (Hegarty 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: Wikipedia Education Program\n\n\n\nThe Wikipedia Education Program exemplifies this holistic approach to open education. In this innovative program, students aren’t just consumers of information but active contributors to one of the world’s largest open knowledge repositories. It provides a learning experience that promotes both learning and collaboration.\nEnhanced Learning Through Contribution  Students, under the guidance of their instructors, create and improve Wikipedia articles related to their course content. This process not only reinforces their understanding of the subject matter but also enhances critical skills such as writing, researching, and collaborative learning. The public nature of Wikipedia means that students’ contributions are viewed and scrutinized by a global audience, adding an authentic, real-world context to the learning experience (Cummings 2009).\nGlobal Knowledge Sharing  Moreover, the Wikipedia Education Program underscores the reciprocal nature of open education. As students benefit from access to open knowledge, they also contribute to expanding this knowledge base, embodying the ethos of communal learning and global knowledge sharing.\n\n\nIn essence, a holistic approach to open education recognizes it as a multifaceted, dynamic process that transforms both teaching and learning. It fosters a learning culture rooted in collaboration, innovation, and the shared creation and dissemination of knowledge. The Wikipedia Education Program serves as a tangible manifestation of these principles, where learning is not just an individual pursuit but a collective, contributive, and globally impactful task."

    "section": "2.5 Benefits of Open Education",
    "text": "2.5 Benefits of Open Education\nThis section will delve into some of the most pivotal advantages: cost reduction, enhanced accessibility, and the fostering of innovation.\n\n2.5.1 Cost Reduction\nOne of the primary barriers to education worldwide is cost. Students often grapple with high fees for tuition, textbooks, and other learning materials, a burden that can limit access and exacerbate educational inequality. Open Educational Resources offer a viable solution. By making high-quality learning materials freely available and open for adaptation, OERs significantly reduce costs for students and educational institutions (Hilton 2016).\nA compelling testament to this is a study by the United States Government Accountability Office revealing that students sometimes have to pay more for the course materials than the tuition for the course itself (United States Government Accountability Office 2013). Opting for OER can save billions for students worldwide. This significant saving underscores the financial impact open education can have, making learning more affordable and accessible to a broader demographic.\n\n\n2.5.2 Accessibility\nBeyond cost, open education amplifies accessibility in other important ways. It ensures that learning isn’t confined to specific locations, times, or societal groups but is available to anyone with access - be it over the internet or otherwise. This democratization of education benefits both inclusivity and diversity, offering individual learning experiences that cater to varied learning styles, needs, and paces (Seaman and Seaman 2018).\n\n\n2.5.3 Innovation\nThe open nature of OERs also spawns innovation in teaching and learning. With the freedom to adapt and modify content, educators can devise novel, contextual, and engaging learning experiences that are aligned with the dynamic needs of the contemporary learner (Wiley and Hilton III 2018). Moreover, students would no longer be passive recipients of knowledge. They’re empowered to explore, interact with, and even contribute to the body of knowledge, catalyzing a more active and participatory learning process."

    "section": "2.6 The Perception of Openness as a Threat",
    "text": "2.6 The Perception of Openness as a Threat\nWhile the myriad benefits of open education are acknowledged globally, there persists a counter-narrative that perceives the openness of educational resources and methodologies as a threat. This perception is rooted in various concerns encompassing the quality of learning, intellectual property rights, and the financial sustainability of educational institutions. Critics argue that the unfettered access and adaptability of OERs could compromise the quality of educational content. The lack of a centralized authority or stringent regulatory framework for content creation and modification raises concerns about the accuracy, reliability, and pedagogical efficacy of OERs (Robinson et al. 2014).\n\n2.6.1 Intellectual Property Rights\nThe open nature of educational content also brings to the fore issues related to intellectual property rights. The freedom to adapt and share content raises questions about authorship, attribution, and the potential misuse of educational materials (Wiley, Bliss, and McEwen 2014):\n\nAuthorship:\n\nRecognition: In open education, content can be shared, adapted, and reused. It raises questions about giving appropriate credit to original authors. While Creative Commons licenses often require attribution, the multiple layers of adaptation and reuse can make authorship acknowledgment complex.\nAcademic Integrity: In academia, authorship is closely tied to professional recognition and advancement. Questions arise on how contributions to OERs are recognized in academic evaluations and career progressions.\n\nQuality Control:\n\nContent Integrity: With open access to modify and distribute content, maintaining the integrity and quality of educational materials can be challenging. There are concerns about the dilution or misinterpretation of content when it’s adapted without appropriate oversight.\nStandardization: Unlike traditional educational materials, which often undergo rigorous peer review and editorial processes, OERs can sometimes lack standardized quality control mechanisms.\n\nEconomic Implications:\n\nRevenue Generation: Content creators, especially publishers, rely on copyright protections to generate revenue. Open access challenges traditional business models, leading to concerns about compensating creators for their work.\nSustainability: The open sharing and adaptation of content can also raise questions about the economic sustainability of content creation. It requires new models for funding and supporting the development of high-quality educational materials.\n\nLegal and Ethical Concerns:\n\nCompliance: Navigating the various licenses and regulations associated with OERs can be complex. Ensuring compliance with both the letter and spirit of these licenses is crucial to maintain the ethical use of content.\nMisuse: The open nature of content also raises the risk of misuse or misappropriation. Safeguarding against such risks while maintaining openness is a nuanced challenge.\n\n\nTo navigate these complexities, initiatives like the Creative Commons have developed a suite of licenses that facilitate the legal sharing, modification, and use of creative works while ensuring attribution to original authors.\n\n\n2.6.2 Financial Sustainability\nIn traditional educational publishing, the creation, distribution, and access to educational materials are often monetized. Publishers invest in the production of high-quality content, and in return, they charge users or institutions for access. This business model ensures a revenue stream that funds the development, quality assurance, and distribution of educational materials.\nOpen education, characterized by free access and the liberty to modify and distribute content, disrupts this economic model. It eliminates or significantly reduces the direct income generated from selling textbooks or access to learning materials. This paradigm shift raises crucial questions about the financial viability of content creation and the sustainability of educational institutions and publishers (Lambert 2018).\nImpact on Stakeholders \n\nEducational Institutions: For educational institutions, the adoption of open educational resources (OERs) can lead to a reduction in income from the sale of textbooks and other proprietary educational materials. Moreover, institutions may face increased costs associated with the curation, adaptation, and maintenance of OERs to ensure their quality and relevance.\nPublishers: Publishers face a direct threat to their revenue as open access challenges the traditional sales and subscription models. With educational materials freely accessible, the value proposition of publishers comes under scrutiny.\n\nNavigating the Challenge  One strategy to mitigate these challenges involves diversifying revenue streams. Educational institutions and publishers can explore alternative means of income, such as offering premium, value-added services, or leveraging open materials to enhance the quality and appeal of their educational offerings.\nAdditionally, funding for the creation and maintenance of OERs can be sourced from public grants, private donations, or partnerships between educational institutions, government bodies, and non-profit organizations. Collaborative funding models can distribute the financial burden and ensure the continued provision of high-quality, accessible educational resources.\nPolicy and regulatory frameworks also play a pivotal role. By establishing policies that support the creation, adaptation, and dissemination of OERs, while ensuring quality and ethical standards, governments can foster an environment where open education thrives without compromising financial sustainability.\nIn practice, some universities and colleges are integrating OERs into their curriculum while maintaining optional paid textbooks or resources for those who prefer them. Publishers, on the other hand, are exploring hybrid models, offering free digital versions while selling physical copies or enhanced digital experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLobbying Against Open Education\n\n\n\nPublishers and content providers, in particular, have been known to lobby against open education policies. Organizations like the Association of American Publishers have expressed concerns that open education, particularly OERs, could lead to a significant loss in market share and revenue, impacting their ability to invest in quality content creation (Feldstein DPS et al. 2012).\nThis underscores the delicate balance that needs to be struck between promoting open access to education and ensuring that the quality of content, intellectual property rights, and financial sustainability are not undermined. It also highlights the need for good quality OERs that are aligned with the needs of contemporary learners and educators.\n\n\nThe perception of openness as a threat underscores the complexities that come with the transition towards a more open educational landscape. While the benefits of open education are evident, these concerns highlight the need for a comprehensive, multi-stakeholder approach to address the challenges and optimize the opportunities in open education. Balancing openness with quality assurance, intellectual property rights, and financial viability is paramount to harnessing the full potential of open education for global learning and development."
