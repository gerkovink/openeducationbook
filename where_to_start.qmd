# Where do you start?

Congratulations on making it this far! Your interest in open educational materials, and your willingness to learn about and implement them, is a testament to your dedication to accessible, equitable, and collaborative learning. Thank you for your commitment to this approach in education.

This chapter is an important waypoint in your open education journey. You've learned about what open education entails in @sec-open_education, and now, you might be wondering how to practically apply it in your own context. We've designed this chapter to guide you through the first steps in that process.

We begin by discussing the choice between making educational materials open prospectively or retrospectively. Both these approaches offer unique challenges and opportunities. Although prospective design of open educational materials will be easier in practice. Understanding the differences and challenges can help you make informed decisions when designing or adapting your resources.

Next, we delve into the legalities associated with open education, focusing on licensing. This can often seem daunting, but it's a crucial aspect to consider. We'll dissect complex terms like Intellectual Property, Copyright, and Public Domain, making them more approachable. We'll also look at the role of Creative Commons licenses, particularly cc-by and cc-by-sa, in facilitating the sharing and usage of open educational materials.

Finally, we'll recap the steps to starting an open education initiative, providing a practical checklist to help you navigate this process. This will include tips on identifying your goals and audience, selecting content and format, planning for accessibility, and fostering a spirit of community collaboration.


## Making it open: Prospective or Retrospective

Embracing open education represents a profound shift in the way we create, share, and interact with educational resources. As you embark on this journey, one of the first decisions you'll encounter is whether to make existing educational materials open (retrospective), start new projects with open education in mind (prospective), or a combination of both. 

Each approach comes with its own set of challenges and rewards. On one hand, opening up existing materials can provide immediate benefits in terms of accessibility and collaboration. On the other hand, this approach can be time-consuming and complex, especially when dealing with issues such as copyright and the technical aspects of transforming existing resources into open formats. 

Starting fresh with open education in mind when developing new materials, however, can often be a more streamlined process. From the outset, you can design your resources to be open, eliminating the need for later adaptations. Yet, this approach may mean that valuable existing resources remain closed off, at least in the short term.

The decision between these two approaches is not a binary one. A successful open education initiative often incorporates elements of both strategies. Opening up materials is always a win, but it's crucial to strike a balance between feasibility, effort, and the eventual result. You might find that while some existing resources lend themselves well to being opened retrospectively, for others, it might be more worthwhile to leave them as they are and focus on incorporating open principles in new projects.

Remember, the ultimate goal is to improve the accessibility and adaptability of educational resources. Whether you achieve this by opening existing materials or designing new ones with openness in mind will depend on your unique circumstances, resources, and goals. Let's explore these two approaches in greater detail.

### Starting Open Prospectively

<!-- 1. Planning for Openness from the Start -->

<!-- - The importance of setting clear goals and understanding your audience. -->

#### Scoping

When embarking on a journey to create open educational materials, having a clear sense of direction is crucial. This starts with setting clear goals for your open education project. What do you hope to achieve by making your educational materials open? Is it to increase (free) access to quality education, promote collaboration among learners, or adapt to diverse learning needs and styles? Having a clear understanding of your goals will guide your decisions throughout the project and help you measure your success. 

At the same time, you should also seek to understand your audience, as this will heavily influence the design and presentation of your open educational materials. Who are your learners? What are their learning needs and preferences? How tech-savvy are they? What languages do they speak? Do they have specific accessibility needs? An understanding of your audience will ensure that your open educational materials are relevant, useful, and accessible to those who need them.

Setting clear goals and understanding your audience might require some research and reflection, but it's worth the effort. These two aspects form the foundation upon which successful open education projects are built. In this section we help you to clarify your goals by means of asking you scoping questions. They ensure that your project stays focused, meets learners' needs, and achieves its intended impact. So before you delve into the details of creating open educational materials, take some time to outline your goals and understand your audience, @tbl-scoping_questions1 can help you. It's your first step towards a successful open education project.

Now that you thought about your goals and target audience, the next step is choosing the right format and platform that suits your needs. In the realm of open education, choosing the appropriate format and platform for your materials is a decision of paramount importance. This choice influences how accessible, adaptable, and collaborative your resources will be.

**Format** pertains to the type of file or medium you'll use to present your content. For instance, while a PDF might be universally readable, it's not as editable as a Markdown or an Office document. Likewise, video materials may be engaging, but they might pose accessibility challenges without accompanying transcripts. @tbl-scoping_questions2 is meant to help you think though your choices. You can fill it out for each of your educational materials and start considering if you are using the right formats. 


| Questions to Consider                                      | Your Answers |
| --- | --- |
| Which educational format will you be using? (e.g., videos, text, interactive exercises) |  |
| How frequently do you anticipate updates to the material?  |  |
| Will there be collaboration with others in content creation or revision? |  |
| Is feedback from users/learners desirable?                 |  |
| Are there any other specific technical requirements or considerations for your materials? |  |
| Do the materials need to be editable?  |  |
| What file formats will you be sharing information in? (e.g., PDF, Powerpoint, Markdown, Jupyter Notebook) Are these formats able to handle the your goals above? |  |

: Considerations for Choosing Format and Platform. {#tbl-scoping_questions2}

**Platform**, on the other hand, is about where and how you host and share your content. The platform dictates how learners access your materials, how they interact with them, and how they collaborate or contribute. While we'll dive deeper into concrete options for platforms in @sec-resources, it's essential to reflect on a few questions when starting to think about designing open materials. A well-chosen format and platform can enhance the openness, reach, and impact of your educational materials, ensuring they resonate with and benefit your intended audience. But how far can, and do you want, to go. For now, we will leave you with a few questions to consider in @tbl-scoping_questions3
